If it were the case, Developers, disinterestedly, would try to correct with patches and updates. </p> <p>If you install and run this App in your Device, you’re using a version in continuous development, which could have bugs and wrong performance, even loss of functionality. </p> <p>This App is Free and, in any moment, Developers aren’t forced to give a 100% working version. If there were bugs and errors in the function of the App, Developers could try to fix them. To get easier this task, the App has a Service that informs in failure cases to Developers giving them information about Force Close conditions.</p> <p>We never collect personal data like user and password.</p> <p>This App asks for permission to manage network connections and control the storage to access UACloud and download/store its content there present. And it’s possible than the App asks for permission to create shortcuts in user’s Android Launcher for getting easier the access to the App, although it isn't a mandatory option. </p> <h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>-About User’s Account</strong></span></h3> <p>With the objective of keeping safe as far as possible Users Accounts (referring to the username and password), User’s Account doesn’t go out of the Device (by no way) to Third Party Servers. Nevertheless, User’s Account information goes to the UACloud, and is stored in a database inside App’s own Directory, which are used on every connection to the UACloud. </p> <p>Despite this information, Developers aren’t responsible of lost and stolen data from User’s Account. </p> <h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>-About the Terms and Conditions:</strong></span></h3> <p>The Terms and Conditions could change if needed, in which case, Developers reserve the right of applying the changes without further notice, and the fact of not knowing the Terms doesn’t exclude of fullfillment of them. </p> <p>You can read these Terms in the Login screen and in an shortcut present in "About" screen option.</p>  <p>In case of inconsistency of translations of this Document, always will prevail the Spanish version over the rest. </p>]]></string>
